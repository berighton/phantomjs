Compiled Phantomjs
------

I needed a compiled version of [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) 2.0 but the authors did not provide a binary for Ubuntu 15. I then tried to compile it myself and ran into a lot of issues ([12941](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12941), [12938](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12938) and [12948](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948)). On a second day, I was finally able to compile it properly and decided to share the binary. 

**Compiled on Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) server edition.
